## Description
Project MyMeal is a personal website to solve pain points in my life about choosing next meal. 

In long run, I hope it can provide 3 functions:
1. recommend one restaurant from your liked.
2. recommend one restaurant based on your liked.
3. recommend one restaurant untried but highly rated!

## Contributing
Now it is developed by myself.
